Here is some text

## A section

Then **some** formula

    f[x_] := Sin[x];

and *an* inline `f[x] = x + 1` formula.

Maybe a block with two lines:

    f[x]+1;
	Expand[f[x]+1];

Or a long line that will span more than one line and will force a linebreak 
in the middle.

And an numbered list:

1. Some item
2. Then another item

and one with abcs:

- asdasdas
- asdadasa

Here is an inline formula $\sin(x)$ and a display formula:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\ c & d
\end{bmatrix}
$$

That's it for now "here and there and everywhere"!
